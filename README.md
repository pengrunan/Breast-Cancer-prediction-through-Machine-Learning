Breast Cancer Study Project
This project code is only used for SIT EE551 WS final project.

Cancer begins with uncontrolled division of one cell,
which results in a visible mass called a tumor. Since
the causes of breast cancer still remain unknown,
early detection is the key to reduce the death rate.
Compared to the conventional methods which rely on
detecting the presence of particular signal features by
a human observer, computer-aided diagnosis
approaches for automated diagnostic systems have
been developed in the past ten years to attempt to
solve this problem. Obtained cell samples by
fine-needle aspirates (FNA) from patients, using
computer based analytical techniques to define
nuclear size, shape, and texture features and then
using these features to distinguish benign and
malignant breast cytology has become a widely
accepted method.
The importance of classifying cell samples into
benign and malignant has led many research teams,
from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to
study the application of machine learning methods
such as Bayes classifiers, artificial neural networks
and supervised fuzzy clustering.

This breast cancer database originates from the
University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, from Dr.
William H. Wolberg in 1991. The total number of
instances is 699, with 10 attributes plus the class
attribute. It includes: 1) sample code number 2) clump
thickness 3) uniformity of cell size 4) uniformity of
cell shape 5) marginal adhesion 6) single epithelial
cell size 7) bare nuclei 8) bland chromatin 9) normal
nucleoli 10) mitoses 11) class. Except for the id
number, all of the variables are categorical, and for
class, 2 denotes benign and 4 symbolizes malignant.
Further, there are 16 missing values (2% of the total)
marked by a question mark (?).
